**File > Swift Packages > Add Package Dependency...**

In the Choose Package Repository prompt add this url:

```

```

```
pod 'Web3Auth', '5.0.0'
```

## Getting Started

Authentication with In-App Web-based Flow (iOS 13+):

1. Import **Web3Auth** into your project.

```swift
import Web3Auth
```

2. Present the In-App Web-based Login modal. The user should see a permission dialog.

```
 Task{
       await Web3Auth()
    .login(OLInitParams(loginProvider: .GOOGLE)) {
        switch $0 {
        case .success(let result):
            print("""
                Signed in successfully!
                    Private key: \(result.privKey)
                    User info:
                        Name: \(result.userInfo.name)
                        Profile image: \(result.userInfo.profileImage ?? "N/A")
                        Type of login: \(result.userInfo.typeOfLogin)
                """)
        case .failure(let error):
            print("Error: \(error)")
        }
    }
    }
```

3. You can check the state variable before logging the user in, if the user has an active session the state variable will already have all the values you get from login so the user does not have to re-login
```
Task{
let web3auth = await Web3Auth()
let state = web3auth.state
}

```

## üåü Configuration

In order to use Web3Auth you need to provide your Web3Auth **ClientId** and which **Network** to run it.

- Go to [Web3Auth Developer Dashboard](https://dashboard.web3auth.io), create or open an existing Web3Auth project and copy your Client ID, which is the **ClientId**.

- Set the clientID and network in the Web3Auth initializer

```
Task {
 await Web3Auth(W3AInitParams(clientId: "BJYIrHuzluClBK0vvTBUJ7kQylV_Dj3NA-X1q4Qvxs2Ay3DySkacOpoOb83lDTHJRVY83bFlYtt4p8pQR-oCYtw", network: .testnet)
}
```

Please also whitelist `\(bundleId)://auth` in the developer dashboard. This step is mandatory for the redirect to work.
